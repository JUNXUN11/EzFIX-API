# EzFIX Backend API

This is the backend for the **EzFIX** web application, built using **Java Spring Boot** with **Java 17**. The backend API is designed to handle the logic behind the **EzFIX** platform, which provides a hostel damage reporting system. The system uses **MongoDB Atlas** for database management and is hosted on **Render**.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend Framework**: Spring Boot 3.0.1
- **Java Version**: 17
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (cloud-based)
- **Deployment**: Render (for hosting), Docker

## Project Purpose & Features

The **EzFIX Backend API** provides functionality for the following:

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and sign-in endpoints using **JWT**.
- **Damage Report Management**: Residents can add, view, and edit damage reports.
- **Admin Features**: Admins can manage reports, upload announcements, and manage users.

This backend serves as the core of the **EzFIX** platform, which enables residents to report hostel-related issues and admins to monitor and resolve them.
